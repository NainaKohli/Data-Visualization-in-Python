## Why Data Visualization is important?
Understanding digits is difficult, interpretation of countless number is difficult unless it is presented in a meaningful way. This is where data visualization comes into play.Human mind is unable to retain and comprehend much of factual data especially when it consist of numbers. Numbers needs to be formatted before any meaningful inferences can be drawn. It becomes easy to understand tables when they are represented pictorially by pie charts, line; bar graphs. Information hidden in numbers is clearly reflected and understood using charts and graphs.
